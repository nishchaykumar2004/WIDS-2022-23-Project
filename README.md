# WIDS-2022-23-Project
This was a team project done under a mentor for a programme called Winter in Data Science (WIDS) at my college. The problem statement was to build a stock predictor by implementing an LSTM neural network.
The repo contains the code as a jupyter file and also a short summary of the code (which is basically the README only).
